This is my fishing app github, outlined below is the general plan.

the goal of this app is to create an instagram type fishing app in which users can post fishing updates such  as catches they have made, etc. This will integrate with an interactive map function, allowing users to find new fishing spots that have had recent success.


 - Login module
     - allows for profile creation with basic details
     - implement encrypted login
     - interfaces with a user database that stores that stuff
     - allow for multi factor authentication, maybe using external APIs
  - User module view
     - Front end html/css
     - Backend flask logic
     - Database tables and SQL queries
  - Admin module view
     - same html and css interface design
     - backend flask logic allowing to see vast user data
     - SQL databases
